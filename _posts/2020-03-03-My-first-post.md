I had always been under the impression that working on the latest technology would make my job or 
internship experience truly enjoyable. To say the least, this is partially correct: What you work
on does matter, but who you work with matters even more.

Having the right support systems such as helpful teammates, and a supportive teammates can really change
make a huge difference when you join a new team. Such systems can help you get unblocked faster, grok new
content and empower you make a big impact in a short time frame.

The same applies for reasearch as well. Say, you have two opportunities. The first is to work at the lab of a 
famous professor and the second, is to work with a relatively new professor. In such a case, we can expect the
following tradeoffs:
- Reputation: Working with a more famous professor can possibly open a lot of door in terms of grants and funding
- Guidance: On the other hand, the availability of the famous professor is bound to be more limited. On the other
hand, the newer professor can afford to be more hands on.

One may ask, which is better? Well, the answer is, it depends...

One factor is the complexity of the task. The higher the complexity of a task, the higher is the probability that 
you would have to look to someone else for help. Second, your willingness to accept assistance from others.

I always used to believe that asking for help is a bad thing. I should always be smart or prepared enough to solve 
problems on my own. This stratergy worked pretty well at school, where work tends to be pretty independent. But, 
this strategy backfired when in came to any workplace as work tends to be pretty collaborative. I had to make a 
conscious decision to ask for help if I was stuck doing a task greater than a certain set deadline. 
And to my surprise, everyone was more than happy to help. In fact, they were worried why I was not asking for 
ÃŸtheir help on a challenging task.

On the other hand, if you want to make collaboration effective, you should ideally do your due dilligence for solving
that task. Google the issue, try different approaches and then share your insights when you ask a question to your co-
worker. This prevents duplication of effort and at the same time can also reveal new solutions when you discuss this with
somebody else.
