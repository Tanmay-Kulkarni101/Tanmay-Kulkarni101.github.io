	<h1> About Me</h1>
	
    <h2>Microsoft India Development Center</h2>
    <h3>2020 August - Present</h3>
	<p>
		 I have worked the past year as a software engineer at Microsoft for the Teams team.
         My role primarily involved syncing data from multiple clients so, as to make sure the 
         data representation remained consistant for all users across all meetings.

    <h2>Microsoft Research</h2>
    <h3>2020 January - August</h3>
    <p>
        Prior to my stint at Microsoft India Development Center, I had interned for six months with
        Amit Sharma in the field of Causality. Here, I had mainly worked on Refuters which mainly tried
        to challenge implicit assumations an analyst makes while trying to construct a model on a dataset.

    <h2>Beat That</h2>
    <h3>2019 July - December</h3>
    <p>
        My first real opportunity in Deep Learning. I had to develop an end to end pipelining, starting from
        data collection and cleaning to actually deploying models on Tensorflow Lite.
